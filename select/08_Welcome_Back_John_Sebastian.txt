Welcome back
Your dreams were your ticket out
Welcome back
To that same old place that you laughed about

Well, the names have all changed
Since you hung around
But those dreams have remained
And they've turned around

Who'd have thought they'd lead you
(Who'd have thought they'd lead you)
Back here where we need you?
(Back here where we need you?)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
'Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back, welcome back

Welcome back
We always could spot a friend
Welcome back
And I smile when I think how you must have been

And I know what a scene
You were learnin' in
Was there somethin' that
Made you come back again?

And what could ever lead you
(What could ever lead you)
Back here where we need you?
(Back here where we need you?)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
'Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back, welcome back

And I know what a scene
You were learnin' in
Was there somethin' that
Made you come back again?

And what could ever lead you
(What could ever lead you)
Back here where we need you?
(Back here where we need you?)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
'Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back, welcome back

Yeah, we tease him a lot
(Welcome back, welcome back)
'Cause we got him on the spot
(Welcome back, welcome back)

Yeah, we tease him a lot
'Cause we got him on the spot
Welcome back

Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
